Haley : Why are you guys yelling at us, when we're way upstairs, just text me.

Claire : Alright, That's not gonna happen, and, wow, you're not wearing that outfit.

Haley : What's Wrong with it?

Claire : Honey, do you have anything to say to your daughter...about her skirt?

Phil : Sorry? Oh yeah, that looks really cute sweetheart!

Haley : Thanks!

Claire : No, it's way to short, people know you're a girl, you don't need to prove it to them.

Alex: Luke got his head stuck in the banister again.

Phil : I got it. Where's the baby oil?

Claire : It's on our bedside tip... I Don't know, find it. Come on!

Claire : I... was out of control growing up,  there, you know, i said it. I...I, I just don't want my kids to make the same bad mistakes i made. If Haley never would exhibit on a beach in Florida, half naked...I've done my job.

Phil : Our job.
