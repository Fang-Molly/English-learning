# **Scene 05: Manny’s room**

Jay: So let’s do this.

Manny: Okay, but I need to be done by three. That’s when my dad’s picking me up.

Jay: Hey, if we’re not done by three, I’m gonna tie a **noose** on this thing.

> * ***noose*** -- n. a circle that is tied in one end of a rope with a knot that allows the circle to get smaller as the other end of the rope is pulled

Manny: My dad’s taking me on Space Mountain. It’s supposed to be really fast, but he’s not scared of anything. He doesn’t even wear a seatbelt when he drives.

Jay: Wow, how about that.

# **Scene 07: Sidewalk**

(Phil comes across a bike left unattended)

(Commentary)

Phil: Ten minutes after making a promise to me, he leaves his bike unlocked. All I can hear is Claire’s voice in my head: “He’s not responsible. You never should’ve given him a bike.” I know. I do a pretty good Claire. So I decided to teach him a lesson and let him think his bike was stolen. And I know that sounds kinda rough, but sometimes it’s a dad’s job to be the tough guy.

(Cut back to scene)

Phil: (riding Luke’s bike) Excuse me, thank you. On your left. My left! Your right!
