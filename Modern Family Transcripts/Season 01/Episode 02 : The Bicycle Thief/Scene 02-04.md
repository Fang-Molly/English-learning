Cameron: It’s a toddler play class, not a flight to Cabo.

(Commentary)

Gloria: Manny’s father is taking him for a couple of days to Disneyland, so we’re gonna go to the wine country!

(Cut back to scene)

Jay: Limo gets here at four. This morning I thought I’d go over to the club and hit a few balls.

Gloria: No. What about the fan in Manny’s room?

Jay: Oh, yeah… Call a guy.

Gloria: Nooo. You’re supposed to do it with him. It’s important that we teach him how to do things for himself. In my culture, men **take great pride in doing physical labour**.

Jay: I know. That’s why I hire people from your culture.
