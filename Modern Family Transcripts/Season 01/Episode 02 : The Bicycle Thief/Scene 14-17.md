# **Scene 14 : Dunphy driveway**

Claire: I mean, I don’t understand. Why are you trying to sneak around and hide things from me? I actually think it’s pretty funny.

Phil: …You do?

Claire: I do, yes. I mean, you steal a bike from some poor kid and then the bike gets stolen from you. It’s hilarious.

Phil: Classic me, right?

Claire: Yes! So, where were you when it got stolen?

Phil: Oh, I was getting some gas…

Claire: Uh huh.

Phil: Yeah.

Claire: You don’t stand near the car when you get gas?

Phil: Yep! But, uh, I went inside… to get a soda because I was thirsty; if I had soda I wouldn’t be thirsty anymore, so I… bought one and then I drank it all right there, which is why I don’t have the can.

Claire: Well, honey, please, let’s try to remember that I’m your wife, not your mom. So in the future, you don’t need to hide things from me, okay?

Phil: Okay.

Claire: Okay.

Phil: (sees Desiree arriving; hugs Claire tighter) Oooh. Oh yeah, you get back here.

Claire: What are you doing? (tries to break free)

Phil: Oh, I just love you so darn much.

Claire: I know, I love you too, but that hurts.

Phil: Let’s get you inside.

Desiree: Hi! Hello, hi there!

Phil: Oh, hi!

Desiree: Hi again! I, uh, found your bike. Uh…

Phil: Oh, good. You- the- at the gas station?

Desiree: No, at my house. One of my neighbours saw it and put it in my garage when you were in my bedroom, so…

Phil: Classic me?

# **Scene 15 : Toddlers play class**

Mitchell: (to Lily) Come on, honey, grab the block. You see, like he did. You gotta do that.

Cameron: Seen any m-movies lately?

Mother: Uh, yeah! You know, my husband and I just rented, uh, Mamma Mia. Which I liked, but I don’t know that Meryl Streep was the right choice. What did you think?

(Commentary)

Cameron: Excuse me. Meryl Streep could play Batman and be the right choice. She’s perfection. Whether she’s divorcing Kramer, whether she’s wearing Prada… Don’t even get me started on Sophie’s Choice; I get emotional thinking about it. (takes a breath) She couldn’t forgive herself… (gets emotional)

(Cut back to scene)

Cameron: Yeah, she was okay.

Mother: Really? Uh. (shakes her head) Uh, uh, uh.

Mitchell: Grab the block, sweetheart. You’re not even interested in-

Teacher: Is Henry stacking? Good job, Henry! Good job!

Mitchell: (steals  other toddler’s stacked blocks, sings) …P, Q, R, S, T, U, V. W, X, Y and Z. Now I know- (finishes dumping Lily’s block next to other toddler) Wow, Lily! Oh, not so high! Oh!

Teacher: That is a big moment for her! Would you like a video tape?

Mitchell: Uh, you know, I-I don’t- I don’t know if I can actually get her to do it again, so…

Teacher: Well, we tape all of our classes! (points to camera on ceiling) We don’t like pointing cameras at them; it keeps them out of the moment. I’ll get you a copy after class.

Mitchell: That super, yeah. Thank you. (teacher leaves) Cam. Cam, let’s go. I- I dunno what’s happened to me, but I just stole a baby’s intellectual property.

Cameron: What?

Mitchell: You’ll see it tonight on the news. Come, let’s just go.

Teacher: Oooh, look who’s here! Anton and Scott! (two gay men enter)

Scott: Sorry we’re late!

Anton: Don’t look at me. The eye candy cutie can’t leave the house without spending twenty minutes in front of the mirror.

Cameron: …Are you kidding me?

Mitchell: I am so sorry.

Cameron: Look at those queens. I would’ve killed with this crowd, but you had to clip my wings, which you used to be the wind beneath.

Mitchell: I know, I’m so- This class has turned me into a complete monster. I’m ju- I’ll make it up to you. Let’s just go.

Teacher: Okay, it’s time for Parents’ Dance! Everybody dance for you baby!

Mitchell: You wanna do it, don’t you?

Cameron: I do. I wanna dance for my baby.

Mitchell: Alright, go on. Get in there.

Cameron: Sure?

Mitchell: Make that horsey move. Go ahead.

Cameron: (runs off; does horsey move in the circle; runs out) Oh, I think I hurt myself.

# **Scene 16 : Pritchett household**

(Manny is sitting alone in the driveway. Inside, Jay’s ready with his luggage; pours himself whisky. Before drinking it, the phone rings)

Jay: Hello? Hey, Javier. Manny’s waiting for you outside. What? Why not? Hold that thought. (drinks whiskey)

(Commentary)

Jay: His son’s sitting on the curb waiting to go to Disneyland, and Superman can’t drag himself away from a craps table. And I’m the jerk.

(Cut back to scene)

Jay: So listen. I, uh… sorry, but I got some bad news.

Manny: What?

Jay: Your dad couldn’t make it.

Manny: Why not?

Jay: The plane was full and this old lady needed to get home, so he gave up his seat.

Manny: You’re making that up, aren’t you?

Jay: No!

Manny: He just didn’t wanna come.

Jay: Are you kidding me? He was very upset! He was dying to see you. In fact, look what he sent. (limo pulls up)

Manny: A limo?!

Jay: Yeah! He wanted me and your mom to take you to Disneyland.

Manny: I told you he was an awesome dad.

Jay: Yeah, he’s a prince.

(Voiceover)

Jay: Okay, the key to being a good dad… Well, sometimes things work out just the way you want them.

(Cut to Phil and Luke cycling down the street)

Luke: I’ll race you to the end.

Phil: That is not a good idea. For you.

(Voiceover)

Jay: Sometimes they don’t. You gotta hang in there….

(Cut to a frustrated Mitchell and Cameron playing with Lily, who does not want to grab blocks)

Jay: …because when all is said and done…

(Cut to Jay and Gloria in limo with a sleeping Manny)

Jay: …ninety percent of being a dad… is just showing up.

--------------------- 

# **Scene 17: Sidewalk**

(Phil returns random kid’s bike where he found it; kid sees him)

Kid: Hey! That’s my bike!

Phil: Oh. I don’t, uh… Well! (runs off; kid and his friend chase after him) I was giving it back!

(Commentary)

Cameron: (crying) She couldn’t forgive herself, and… she had to choose! And I think because now I have- we have- we have L-… we have Lily, it’s so hard to imagine being put in that position. If I had to choose Lily or Mitchell, I mean, I would choose L-… I don’t know! (gets up; walks off) I just, I don’t know! I don’t know! I don’t know!
