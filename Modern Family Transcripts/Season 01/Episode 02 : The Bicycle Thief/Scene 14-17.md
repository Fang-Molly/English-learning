> * ***hide sth from sth***

Phil: Classic me, right?

Claire: Yes! So, where were you when it got stolen?

Phil: Oh, I was getting some gas…

Claire: Uh huh.

Phil: Yeah.

Claire: You don’t stand near the car when you get gas?

Phil: Yep! But, uh, I went inside… to get a soda because I was thirsty; if I had soda I wouldn’t be thirsty anymore, so I… bought one and then I drank it all right there, which is why I don’t have the can.

Claire: Well, honey, please, let’s try to remember that I’m your wife, not your mom. So in the future, you don’t need to hide things from me, okay?

Phil: Okay.

Claire: Okay.

Phil: (sees Desiree arriving; hugs Claire tighter) Oooh. Oh yeah, you get back here.

Claire: What are you doing? (tries to break free)

Phil: Oh, hi!

Desiree: Hi again! I, uh, found your bike. Uh…

Phil: Oh, good. You- the- at the gas station?

Desiree: No, at my house. One of my neighbours saw it and put it in my garage when you were in my bedroom, so…

Phil: Classic me?

Mitchell: (to Lily) Come on, honey, grab the block. You see, like he did. You gotta do that.

Cameron: Seen any m-movies lately?

Mother: Uh, yeah! You know, my husband and I just rented, uh, Mamma Mia. Which I liked, but I don’t know that Meryl Streep was the right choice. What did you think?

(Commentary)

Cameron: Excuse me. Meryl Streep could play Batman and be the right choice. She’s perfection. Whether she’s divorcing Kramer, whether she’s wearing Prada… Don’t even get me started on Sophie’s Choice; I get emotional thinking about it.

> * ***keep sb out of sth*** -- prevent sb from being involved in sth

Scott: Sorry we’re late!

Anton: Don’t look at me. The eye candy cutie can’t leave the house without spending twenty minutes in front of the mirror.

Cameron: …Are you kidding me?

Mitchell: I am so sorry.

Teacher: Okay, it’s time for Parents’ Dance! Everybody dance for you baby!

Mitchell: You wanna do it, don’t you?

Cameron: I do. I wanna dance for my baby.

Mitchell: Alright, go on. Get in there.

Cameron: Sure?

Mitchell: **Make that horsey move.** Go ahead.

Cameron: (runs off; does horsey move in the circle; runs out) Oh, I think I hurt myself.
