Jay: What’s the key to being a great dad? Uh, that’s a tough one.

Cameron: Giving them the freedom to be whatever they wanna be.

Mitchell: Right, exactly, s-

Cameron: Whether that’s a painter, a poet, a pilot, a president-

Mitchell: And for us-

Cameron: -of a company or of a country.

Mitchell: …Patience.

Phil: Well, be their buddy.

Claire: …That’s your answer?

Phil: And stay in school.

Claire: No.

Phil: And don’t do drugs.

Claire: Nooo.

Phil: Just give me the answer!

Claire: Oh god.

Jay: …Still thinking.

 

Scene: Street
(Claire, Phil and Luke are cycling)

Woman: Hi Claire!

Claire: Hey.

Woman: Hey!

Claire: Oh, okay. Hi, um…this is my husband, Phil.

Phil: Hi.

Claire: And, uh, that’s my son, Luke, right there. This is…

Woman: Desiree.

Claire: Desiree. Right, sorry. Desiree just moved in down the block.

Phil: Fun. Where?

Desiree: Three-fourteen.

Phil: Oh, the two bedroom cottage with the indoor outdoor family room.

Desiree: Very good! How did you-

Phil: I bet you’re loving that steam shower.

Claire: Phil, that’s creepy.

Phil: Oh, sorry. I’m a real estate mogul. What? I’m- I am a real estate agent. Um, we caravaned that house. Great, uh, deck.

Desiree: Thanks. I’m just there ’til my divorce is final.

Phil: Now who is coconuts enough to divorce you?

Claire: Oh, we gotta go. But we’ll see you around.

Phil: Well, we’d love to have you over sometime.

Desiree: I’d love it.

Phil: Alright!

Desiree: Bye.

Phil: Bye. (Desiree runs off) She’s awesome.

Claire: No, we are never having her over. Her charity slept with two dads from the school.

Phil: What?

Claire: Mhh hmm.

Phil: That’s… horrible.

Luke: Dad, watch out!

Phil: Woah, watch it buddy!

Luke:. Grandma

Phil: I’m sorry. That still looks like a girl’s bike.

Claire: Well, we’ll add more black tape.

Phil: My son has been riding his sister’s old bike.

Claire: Until he’s responsible enough to take care of his own bike. Look, he spilled a soda on my computer, he ruined our digital camera taking pictures of himself underwater-

Phil: It’s a girl’s bike. I’m all for teaching him a lesson, but I worry about the ridicule he might get from some… loudmouth bully.

(Cut back to scene)

Jay: (driving past) Heeeey! Nice bike, Sally.

Claire: Dad.

Jay: Come on, he looks like Little Bo Beep on that thing.

Phil: Actually, not for long. He’s getting a new bike this afternoon.

Luke: I am?

Phil: Mhhh.

Claire: He is?

Phil: …

(Commentary)

Phil: Sometimes a man’s gotta put his foot down and do what a man’s gotta do, and if the old lady don’t like it – honey? (silence) – that’s too damn bad.
