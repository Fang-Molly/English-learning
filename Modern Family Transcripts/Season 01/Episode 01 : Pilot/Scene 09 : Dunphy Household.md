(Outside)

Phil: Buddy… what are you wearing?

Luke: (wearing multiple layers of clothing) Nothing.

Phil: Uh uh. No jacket, one hat. How many pairs of underwear do you have on?

Luke: One… ugh, six.

(Inside)

Alex: First of all, it would be really cool to see Hayley that fat, and how awesome would it be to have a fake little brother who’s really my nephew.

Claire: Hayley is not getting pregnant.

Alex: Just saying if.

Claire: I know. And I know you like to make trouble for your sister, but it’s not gonna work this time. You know why? ‘Cause your sister is a good girl. I know; I was just like her when I was… (walks off)

(Outside)

Phil: I want you to know: I’m not enjoying this, but this is an important lesson that you’re learning, so soak it, keep it. (aims BB gun at Luke)

Luke: You’re too close. It’s gonna hurt.

Phil: It’s supposed to hurt.

Luke: And why are you smiling?

Phil: I’m… what?

(Inside)

Claire: (climbs stairs and stands outside Hayley’s room)

(Outside)

Phil: Oh, forget it. I can’t do this. The point is you’re scared. I think you’ve learned your lesson- (BB gun goes off) Wow.

Luke: Ow!

(Inside)

Claire: (enters Hayley’s room)

Hayley: Mom? What are you doing?

Claire: Oh, hey. I was just, um, dropping off some laundry. Is this a bad time?

Hayley: Yeah.

Claire: Oh. Okay. (leaves)

Hayley: Can you shut the door, please?

Claire: Actually, we’re just gonna go ahead and leave that open.

Hayley: Why?

Claire: Because I have, uh, seen this little show before, lying on the bed with a tall senior. One moment you’re just friends watching Falcon Crest, and the next you’re lying under the air hockey table with your bra in your pocket.

Dylan: Woah…

Hayley: Mom!

(Outside)

Luke: You hit my bone!

Phil: It was an accident!

Luke: I thought you were my friend!

Phil: I am your friend!

Hayley: Dad! Dad! Dad, you have got to talk to mom. She’s, like, completely freaking out and embarrassing me!

Phil: Well, honey, your mom isn’t always as cool about things as I- (BB gun goes off)

Dylan: Ow!

Phil: What is with this thing?! (drops gun; gets shot in the leg) Ow!
