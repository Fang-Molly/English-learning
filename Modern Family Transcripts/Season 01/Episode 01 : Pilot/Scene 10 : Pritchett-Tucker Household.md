Mitchell: My dad… Uh, my dad still isn’t completely **comfortable with**… this. Um, he still does this thing – it’s been five years now – and he still does this thing where he **announces himself** before walking into any room we’re in, just to make sure he doesn’t ever have to see us kiss.

Mitchell: Cam.

Cameron: (bumps Mitchell) Do it.

Mitchell: Alright, okay.

Cameron: Go.

Mitchell: Sorry. (takes deep breath; answers door) Hey!

Family: Hey!

Mitchell: How are you? (gets wine from Phil) Thank you.

Claire: Oh, don’t thank us. Open it; dad is coming right behind. (doorbell rings again)

Phil: Okay. (starts feeling Gloria)

Claire: Phil. That’s how she says “Phil”. Not “feel”. “Phil”.

Phil: Oh.

Jay: So how was your trip?

Mitchell: It was good. It was good, actually, but, um, about that… I… I have something that I need to tell you guys. Um… uh, we didn’t just go to Vietnam **for pleasure**. We, uh… **kinda** have some big news.

Jay: Well, kids need a mother. I mean, if you two guys are bored, get a dog.

Mitchell: We’re not bored, dad.

Gloria: I support you, Mitchell, even though you’re not my son.

>    * Chillax, dude - I'm on your team.

Alex: Hey, where’s uncle Cameron?

Mitchell: Final- thank you. Thank you. Someone who’s not insulting me notices he’s not here.

Jay: Aaah, so that’s the big announcement, huh? You two **broke up**. Well, a baby wasn’t gonna help that anyway. And you know, let me tell you: you’re a lot **better off** because he was a bit of a **drama queen**.

Mitchell: Okay, no, no, no, stop! You come into my house and you insult me and my boyfriend who, by the way, is not that dramatic and- (“Circle of Life” starts playing; lights dim) Oh god… (Cameron enters carrying Lily; holds her up as spotlight shines on her) We adopted a baby. Her name is Lily.

Cameron: Isn’t it exciting?

Mitchell: Just **turn it off**.

Cameron: I can’t turn it off; it’s who I am.

Mitchell: The music.

Cameron: Oh, yes, the music. (turns it off) Come say hi to Lily! (Family fawns over Lily; Jay stands from afar)

Phil: Lily. Isn’t that gonna be hard for her to say?

Jay: Um, excuse me. Okay, I-I know that I said I thought this was a bad idea, but, uh… what do I know? I mean, it’s not like I wrote the book on **fatherhood**. I’ve been trying all my life to get it right; I’m still **screwing up**. Right, Manny?

Manny: I wrote a song about it in the car.

Jay: Of course you did. Uh… anyway, I’m happy for you and, uh, you should know that, uh, I’m not here to spit in your face; I’m here to blow at your back. (family’s confused) It’s supposed to sound better in Spanish.

Gloria:(repeats quote in Spanish)

Cameron: Ah, that’s beautiful.

Jay: Anyhow, Mitch…

Mitchell: No, dad, it’s… (takes Lily) Do you wanna meet grandpa?

Jay: Are you kidding? She’s one of us now. Let me see your little podsticker. Hey! You’re a cutie, aren’t you? Ah.

(Commentary)

Jay: (reading Manny’s poem) “We’re from different worlds… yet we somehow fit together. Love is what binds us through **fair and stormy weather**. I stand before you now with only one **agenda**: to let you know my heart is yours, Feldman comma Brenda.” (laughs) I mean, seriously!

(Cut to Phil and Luke playing basketball)

Phil: It’s 2-0. It’s 2-0. (proceeds to score)

Phil: (after stopping Luke from scoring) Get that weak stuff out of my kitchen!

Phil: **Do me a favour**, just… (distracts Luke; scores) Boom! How’s the weather down there?

> * ***do sb a favour*** -- do sth for sb

(Commentary)

Phil: But, when the day comes that he does win – if, you know, if, when… he beats me – I’m just gonna be like, “Well done, well done.” Just, like, let him, just support him and that kinda stuff. I mean, I’m probably gonna wanna go, like, two out of three and just see what happens there.

> * ***When the day comes that ...***
>
>    * When the day comes that the virus mutates its way around this, we may be in real trouble.
